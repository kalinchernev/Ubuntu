# Tired of setting up folders and files for every new virtual host at your environment? This script can help you.
# SetupWebProject.sh automates the setup of new web projects on Apache in the following way:
# * takes user input for name of the project - i.e. example.dev
# * creates a project folder at /var/www with input project name
# * creates an example file with HTML in the root folder of the newly created project folder
# * sets necessary permissions on new project files and folders to be editable
# * populates initial index.html file with HTML with welcoming instructions
# * setups the necessary folders at /etc/apache2 folders for new virtualhost project
# * enables the new virtualhost project site using default functions from apache2
# * includes a new entry inside /etc/hosts file for reaching the project with pretty url
# * restarts apache2 service

# Clear the screen
clear
# Take value for user project name
echo "Please enter desired name for your project, i.e. example.dev"
read -p "Project name: " project_name
echo "Creating $project_name ..."
# Creating project folder
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/$project_name/public_html
echo "Project folder has been created."
# Makes sure the user has permissions on the project folder
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/$project_name/public_html
# Ensure anyone can read the files
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
# Creates and example index.html file in the project folder
touch /var/www/$project_name/public_html/index.html
# Take ownership over the project folder
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/www/$project_name/public_html/index.html
# Create a starting file
cat <<EOF >> /var/www/$project_name/public_html/index.html
<html>
	<head>
	<title>$project_name index file</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>$project_name is ready!</h1>
    <p>This index file is located at: /var/www/$project_name/public_html/index.html<p>
	<p>So. project folder is at: /var/www/$project_name/public_html</p>
	<p>VirtualHost has been created with the name of your project: http://$project_name/</p>
    <p>Happy coding!<p>
